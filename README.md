## Shortcodes
You are now ready to place the shorcodes on the landingpages  

A shortcode is a piece of syntax that can be inserted anywhere in the WordPress text editor, and will then be processed into some kind of functionality. You can imagine shortcodes as building blocks you can move around. Shortcodes have optionally attributes, that change their output.  
A shortcode is delimited by square brackets, for example __[bdt_cta type="TestDrive"]__  
<br><br>
__Examples of building the searchpage / resultlist and vehicledetailspage are shown at the end of this section__<br><br>

### Setup your forms to send leads to AutoDesktop  
To be able to send leads to AutoDesktop you need to create forms on the pages that you have specified on the settingspage of the AutoIt plugin.  

![forms](https://www.autoit.dk/Media/autoit-dealer-tools/bdt-adt-leads-1.png)  

To be able to send leads when the forms get submitted, you need to set the IDâ to the specific inputs fields.
Se example below to see an example with the Contact Form 7 plugin.  

![contactform7](https://www.autoit.dk/Media/autoit-dealer-tools/bdt-adt-leads-2-contactform7.png)  

To show a car-card next to the form, as showed below, use this shortcode: [bdt_vehicle_card]  

![contactform](https://www.autoit.dk/Media/autoit-dealer-tools/bdt-adt-leads-3.png)  

__NB The vehicle-card will only be visible, when a client comes directly from a vehicle detailspage.__<br><br>

### Widgets  
__[bdt_widget]__
Required attribute:  
* __type__  

Supported widget-types:  
* Consent - Samtykke widget
* AutoDesktopLeads - Currently only Book PrÃ¸vetur is supported
* Santander - Santander widget. WORKS ONLY IN VEHICLE DETAIL PAGE.  


The widgets should work without any additional parameters, as the usual clientID parameter is resolved automatically by association to the companyId associated with the current API key. Widgets can be used anywhere in your WordPRess installation, except for Santander widget that can only be used on a vehicle detail page, because it requires some inputs about a vehicle to be displayed.  

The [bdt_widget] shortcode can be opened in order to insert some content and put a link on it. In such case, the widget won'd be embedded; but when the link is clicked, a new window opens with a widget inside.
In case that your desired widget type doesn't show up, make sure that it had been activated for your company - contact Biltorvet A/S support to get a widget activated for your API key. Additionaly, you may want to reuse a specific widget ID instead of relying on automatic resolve. For that, use externalid attribute, for example [bdt_widget externalid="XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXX"].  

__Widget attributes__  
All widgets have following common attributes, that you can use to tweak their appearance for your particullar instance:  

* color - sets the primary theme color for the given widget.
* logourl - sets the URL for the logo to be displayed inside.
* fontcolor - sets the primary theme color for the font inside.
* fontfamily - sets the google font to be loaded for the whole widget. (not implemented yet)  

Example 1: [bdt_widget type="Santander" color="#ff0000"]<br><br>

![detailspage](https://www.autoit.dk/Media/autoit-dealer-tools/bdt-details-old-3.png)<br><br>


### Searchpage and resultlist  
When using the plugin it's important to notice that the searchpage and resultlist won't work optiomal unless the landingpage used for the shortcodes is placed in the root of the domain.  
<br>
Example 1: __demo1.biltorvet.as/brugte-biler__ - Everything will work justfine.  
Example 2: __demo1.biltorvet.as/out-new-homepage/brugte-biler__ - Filtering options, pagination and such won't work as it should.  
<br>
Be sure to remember this when creating a website using this plugin.  
<br>
__Share links with predefined searchfilters__  
The URL are build to make it easy to share pages with predefined searchfilters. The url build like this:  
__/1/make/model__   
<br>

The first paramater is the pagination number, the second parameter is the make of the vehicle and the third parameter is the model of the vehicle.  
<br>
Example 1: __/1/audi/__ - Will show the searchpage with all the Audi's for sale  
Example 2: __/1/audi/a5__ - Will show the searchpage with all the Audi A5's for sale
